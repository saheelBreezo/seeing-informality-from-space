# Identification and Analysis of Slum Characteristics using Earth Observation and GIS methods in Rio de Janeiro and Nairobi
A case study on assessment of spatial characteristics of informal settlement using earth observation data and GIS.

## Introduction
Mapping slum areas presents unique challenges due to the variable spatial patterns of slum populations and the absence of a standard definition of what constitutes a "slum" (*Kuffer et. al., 2016*). These areas are often missing from census data and urban planning, making mapping difficult (*Kuffer et. al., 2016*). Despite these challenges, up-to-date information on slum areas is essential for effective urban interventions and sustainable development planning. Developments in remote sensing and GIS have provided tools to study and analyze slums more effectively than traditional survey-based mapping. This case study is an attempt to use those tools to enhance the understanding of slum areas. The study aims to analyze the physical characteristics of slum settlements and their surroundings, comparing them with other informal and formal settlements both locally and internationally.
